# Software Engineering Game Development Docs

This repo is a collection of documents for game development with a Software Engineering approach. Documents are prefixed by their genre (eg `platformer`)

## Developent Approach

1. Track work
2. Document features
3. Write unit tests
4. Develop code
5. Play test

The idea is, first have an idea and put it on Trello. Document this idea to formalize it. If I don't know it well enough to formalize it, then I must learn it.
Once the idea is formalized into a document, I can write unit tests that the feature must satisfy. Code will then be developed to pass all the unit tests.

Play testing the feature comes last in this development process. It is easy to overlook specifics and go by feel with play testing. Since this is an engineering
practice, we want to go through the rigors of defining our product well before building it.

## Implementing Approach

### General

1. Trello
2. Markdown

### Python
3. unittest
4. pygame

### Java
3. JUnit
4. libGDX

## Learning

I meantioned learning in the Development Appraoch section. There are two courses of learning to address:
1. Learning *how* to implement a feature through experimentation. That is, experiments are one-off small projects that are not committed to the code base.
2. In the Implementation Approach I list (as of 2024-04-21) two languages for implementing my features. This list may grow, the intention is to grow my polyglot programming skills through game development.
