# Software Engineering Game Development Docs

This repo is a collection of documents for game development with a Software Engineering approach. Documents are prefixed by their genre (eg `platformer`)

## Developent Approach
1. Track work: Idea -> Trello
2. Formulate idea to a document -> Markdown file in git repo
3. Write unit test for feature
4. Develop feature to satisfy the unit test
5. Play test the feature


## Technology Stack
1. Trello
2. Git + Markdown
3. Python unittest, Java JUnit
4. Python pygame, Java libGDX


## Why two?
I am comfortable developing in Python and want a similar level of comfort in Java. Game development touches many areas of development, so it is ideal for translating my python skills.
